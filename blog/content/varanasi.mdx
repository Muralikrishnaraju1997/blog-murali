# Where Life Ends and Life Begins Again in the Oldest Living City of the World

**Varanasi** is not just a city. It is an emotion, a question, and also an answer.  

Many people say that it is the place where life ends, but at the same time, it is also the place where life begins again. When you walk through the streets of Varanasi or sit near its ghats, you can feel both life and death living together like two sides of the same coin.  

Hi, I am **Murali Krishna Raju**, and my one and only dream is to go to Varanasi. My aim is simple: I want to feel the depth of life and ask myself the most important question, *“Who am I?”*  

I want to understand what death truly means and why people believe that the journey of life and death finds its answer in this ancient city.  


## A City Older Than Time

Varanasi, also called **Kashi** or **Banaras**, is said to be one of the oldest living cities in the world.  

For thousands of years, people from different parts of India and even the world have come here in search of peace, truth, and liberation.  

The city stands on the banks of the holy river **Ganga**, and every ghat tells a story. Some ghats are known for prayer and celebrations, while some ghats are known for final goodbyes.  

Walking here, one can feel that time slows down. The city teaches us that nothing is permanent. Life changes every minute, and **Varanasi is the mirror that shows us this truth clearly.**  


## Life and Death at the Ghats

The ghats of Varanasi are not just steps leading to the river. They are full of emotions.  

Every ghat has its own energy, its own meaning. There are ghats where life ends, where the fire of cremation rises every day. Yet, there are also ghats where life begins again, where children laugh, devotees pray, and pilgrims take their first holy dip.  

It is strange, but in Varanasi, **life and death stand side by side**. The same river Ganga washes away the sorrow of one family while giving hope to another.  

People believe that taking the last breath here brings **moksha**, liberation from the cycle of birth and death. For them, death here is not an end but a beginning of a new journey.  

Among the many ghats in Varanasi, **Manikarnika Ghat** is the most sacred and powerful. It is said to be the place where life truly ends and a new journey begins.  

Every day, funeral pyres burn here without stopping, day and night, for centuries. For many, it is not a place of fear but a place of peace, because they believe that leaving the world here connects the soul to something beyond life.  

According to legend, **Goddess Parvati** once lost her *mani* (jewel) from her *karna* (ear) while bathing in the Ganga. Lord Shiva searched for it and declared that this place would forever hold a special meaning. Since then, **Manikarnika** has been seen as a doorway between one world and the next.  

On one side, you see the burning pyres and hear the chants of *“Ram Naam Satya Hai.”* For centuries, families have brought their loved ones here for their final rites.  

Some even spend their last days in Varanasi, waiting for their time to come, because they believe that leaving the world here gives the soul peace and rest.  


## The Mystery of the Aghoris

One cannot talk about Varanasi without speaking of the **Aghoris**.  

They are mysterious saints who live near cremation grounds, where most people feel fear. But for Aghoris, death is not something to fear. They see it as a path to truth.  

Their way of living is different and strange to many. They remind us that life is not only about comfort but also about facing the reality of death.  

For me, the thought of Aghoris raises deep questions:  

- What is life?  
- What is death?  
- Who am I beyond my body and mind?  

When I think of Varanasi, I feel that maybe only there, in the silence of the ghats or in the chanting of prayers, I can search for these answers.  


## My Dream to Visit Varanasi

Everyone has a dream that feels close to their heart. For me, that dream is to **visit Varanasi**.  

It is not about travel, not about tourism, but about feeling something deeper.  

For me, Varanasi is not just a destination on the map; it is a destination of the soul.  

I imagine myself walking on the ghats early in the morning, watching the sunrise over the Ganga, hearing the sound of bells, and seeing life in its purest form.  

The sight of priests offering prayers, the sound of chants echoing across the river, and the gentle waves touching the steps of the ghats — all of it feels like a reminder that life is both fragile and eternal.  

Some may ask me: *“You have not visited Varanasi, so why do you talk about it with such depth?”*  

My answer is simple: **Varanasi lives in the imagination of every seeker.**  

Even before setting foot there, the city pulls you with its stories, its history, and its spiritual power.  

In the past, elders used to believe that if someone traveled to Varanasi, they might not return — because the city was seen as a final stop. Families worried when someone spoke about visiting Kashi, as it meant the end was near.  

But today, the meaning has changed. Varanasi is no longer only a city of endings — it is also a city of beginnings.  

For me, the dream of visiting Varanasi is not about fear, but about peace.  

I want to sit on the ghats and ask myself the deepest question: *“Who am I?”*  

Because if I can understand death, maybe then I can truly understand life.  


## The Culture, Rituals, and Everyday Life

Apart from life and death, Varanasi is also full of color, sound, and taste.  

The streets are narrow but alive with people, food stalls, music, and prayers. **Sadhus, priests, locals, and tourists walk side by side.**  

The **Ganga Aarti** at Dashashwamedh Ghat is one of the most powerful rituals you can witness. The sound of conch shells, the flames of the lamps, and the chanting together create a feeling that touches the soul.  

The city also has temples at almost every corner, the most famous being the **Kashi Vishwanath Temple**, dedicated to Lord Shiva. People believe that visiting this temple cleanses one’s soul.  

And of course, the **food of Varanasi** has its own charm. From hot kachoris in the morning to sweet jalebis and Banarasi paan, the taste of the city adds to the entire experience.  


## Why Varanasi Calls Everyone

It is often said that no one can plan their journey to Varanasi; the city itself calls you when the time is right.  

Many people go there to pray, some to celebrate festivals, some to study, and some to say goodbye to loved ones.  

But in the end, everyone finds something peace, truth, or simply themselves.  

For me, Varanasi is not just about visiting a place. It is about listening to my inner voice. It is about facing the mystery of life and death, and learning to accept both with a calm heart.  


## The Eternal Question: Who Am I?

Every person, at some point, asks the question  *Who am I?*  

Some ignore it, some fear it, and some search for the answer.  

**Varanasi is the place where this question feels natural.**  

Watching the circle of life and death so closely makes you realize that we are more than just a body.  

Maybe we are a soul. Maybe we are on a journey. Maybe we are something beyond words.  

But the first step to knowing is to ask. And I believe, in Varanasi, I can find the courage to ask and the silence to listen.  


## Conclusion: The City of Truth

Varanasi is not just a city you visit. It is a city that changes you.  

It shows you that life and death are not separate, but connected.  

It teaches you that everything is temporary, yet everything is eternal in some form.  

For me, it is the dream of a lifetime to go there, to sit near the Ganga, to feel the presence of the divine, and to understand what death is really about.  

More than anything, I want to feel the answer to my deepest question *Who am I?*  

In the end, Varanasi is not about finding the city.  
**It is about finding yourself.**
