# When Passion Hurts: My Journey Through **My Previous Company**, **Digital Marketing**, and the Pain of Growing in a Business-First World

When I first stepped into the world of **Digital Marketing**, I had nothing but curiosity, hunger, and a stubborn belief that if I worked hard enough, one day I would understand the depth of this field and build something meaningful. I came with dreams bigger than myself and with a heart that genuinely wanted to learn, grow, and evolve. And like most journeys, mine began in a place I now look back at with mixed emotions — **my previous company**. I always imagined the beginning of my career to be filled with encouragement, guidance, mentorship, and inspiration. But instead, I walked into a world that saw marketing only as execution, branding only as output, and employees only as resources. For them, it was business. For me, it was passion. And that contradiction slowly shaped both my growth and my pain.

Before anyone misunderstands, let me say this clearly: according to Indian law, everything I write here is my personal experience, my personal emotions, and my personal journey. I am not degrading any organization. I am not accusing anyone. I am simply sharing the truth within me — the truth that many people hide, the truth that suffocates young professionals until they forget why they even started. My words come from a place of honesty, vulnerability, and survival. And maybe someone reading this right now needs to hear it.

When I joined **my previous company**, I felt hopeful. It was my first real step into the professional world. I believed that a place connected to **Digital Marketing** would understand emotion, creativity, vision, and purpose. But what I walked into was a space where everything revolved around deadlines, tasks, and survival. There was no ecosystem for creativity, no structured learning, no true guidance, and no emotional acknowledgment for the work we were doing. Everything felt transactional — and nothing kills passion faster than an environment without soul.

I kept telling myself that this was temporary, that things would eventually change, that as I learned more, I would feel more connected. But the reality was that every day felt heavier. They didn’t see **Digital Marketing** the way I saw it. They didn’t feel branding the way I felt it. They didn’t understand the emotional depth that goes into creating campaigns that move people, because for the management, it was simply **business**, nothing more, nothing less. And that disconnect started eating me from the inside.

But the real struggle was not the work. It was the emotional exhaustion caused by things that should have been simple — like salaries not arriving on time. When you are new to your career, living with hope and limited savings, even small delays break you. Every month became a cycle of fear and uncertainty. I began to wonder whether this was the reality of professional life or if I had chosen the wrong path altogether. Every time the date passed, every time the message didn’t come, every time I had to adjust my life because of something that should have been basic, the fire inside me dimmed a little more.

Still, I continued. Not because the system supported me, but because somewhere inside me, I believed my passion for **Digital Marketing** would carry me through. But passion cannot survive in an environment where it feels unrecognized. Passion cannot grow where it is treated as just another job. And that is exactly what began to happen — my passion started transforming into fear.

I remember sitting at my desk, staring at the screen, and asking myself, “Where is my passion going? Why do I feel like I’m losing myself?” Those questions haunted me for months. It wasn’t the workload. It wasn’t the pressure. It wasn’t the clients. It was the environment that treated creativity like a checklist, treated branding like a routine, and treated employees like robots who did not need emotional space.

If you are reading this and you are working in a similar environment, listen carefully to the pain in my words: **If a company treats your passion like a job, soon your passion will die inside you. And nothing is more painful than losing the dreams you once held with both hands.**

But amidst all the chaos, there was something beautiful — the people. The friendships I made in **my previous company** were real. The colleagues who shared the same pain, the same hopes, the same frustrations, and the same dreams were the only reason I lasted longer than I should have. They made the unbearable moments bearable. They added laughter to days of stress. They turned suffocating pressure into shared resilience. And for that, I am forever grateful. I didn’t earn the best salary, I didn’t get the best guidance, but I earned brothers and sisters — the kind you cannot forget in life.

But even friendship cannot erase the truth. And the truth was that I could no longer recognize the person I was becoming. I was waking up with anxiety instead of excitement. I was questioning my decisions instead of trusting them. I was shrinking instead of growing. And when your passion starts to suffocate, leaving is not a choice — it becomes a necessity for survival.

So I walked away. Not out of anger. Not out of hate. But out of self-respect.

But leaving didn’t feel like leaving a job. It felt like walking away from a version of myself that I refused to become. It felt like taking back the passion that was slowly dying. It felt like choosing myself after months of losing myself. And that courage has shaped who I am today.

After leaving, I understood something deeper — many businesses still do not understand what **Digital Marketing** truly means. They think it's posting, designing, advertising, and reporting. But it is so much more. It is storytelling, emotion, psychology, connection, creativity, brand voice, market understanding, audience insight, and long-term vision. It is a relationship between a brand and the people it serves. It is not just business — it is heart. And when companies treat marketing like a checkbox instead of a craft, they lose the very essence of brand building.

If you are a young marketer reading this, I want you to remember something that took me years to understand:  
**Your passion is a gift. Do not give it to a place that cannot recognize it.**  
If your environment suffocates your creativity, leave.  
If your efforts go unseen, leave.  
If your dreams start fading, leave.  
If your identity starts disappearing, leave.  

Because you deserve a workplace that sees your value, respects your time, honors your passion, and recognizes your talent. You deserve leaders who understand branding is emotion, not execution. You deserve mentors who help you grow, not systems that drain you. You deserve more than just business — you deserve purpose.

Looking back at **my previous company**, I no longer feel anger. I feel gratitude for the lessons, even the painful ones. That experience taught me the difference between a job and a passion, between a business and a dream, between survival and growth. It taught me who I am — and who I refuse to become. It taught me that pain can shape you, break you, and eventually build you stronger than before.

To everyone who feels trapped in their **previous company**, afraid to leave, afraid to lose stability, afraid to lose connections — I know your pain. I lived that pain. But trust me, choosing yourself will always be worth it. When you walk away from the wrong place, you move closer to the right version of yourself.

In the end, this is not a story about a company. This is a story about me — my emotions, my passion, my fear, my growth, and the journey that made me who I am today. Everything written here is my own experience, my own truth. According to Indian law, sharing personal experience is not defamation. It is my right. And I hope someone finds strength in my story.

Thank you for reading this piece of my heart. If even one person feels understood because of this blog, then my pain has helped someone — and that makes all of this worth it.
